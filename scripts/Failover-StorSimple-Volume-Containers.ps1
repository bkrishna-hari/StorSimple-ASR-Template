.DESCRIPTION
    This runbook performs a failover of the StorSimple volume containers corresponding to the particular Azure Site Recovery failover.
    Unplanned failover - The specified volume containers are failed over to the target Device
    Planned failover - Backups of all the volumes in the volume containers are taken based on the backup policies which were last used to take a successful backup and then the volume containers are failed over on to the Target Device
    Test failover - All the volumes in the volume containers are cloned on to the target Device
    Failback - It performs the same steps as in the case of a planned failover with the Source Device and Target Device swapped
     
.ASSETS 
    [You can choose to encrypt these assets ]
    
    AzureCredential [Windows PS Credential]:
        A credential containing an Org Id username / password with access to this Azure subscription
        Multi Factor Authentication must be disabled for this credential

    The following have to be added with the Recovery Plan Name as a prefix, eg - TestPlan-StorSimRegKey [where TestPlan is the name of the recovery plan]
    [All these are String variables]

    'RecoveryPlanName'-AzureSubscriptionName: The name of the Azure Subscription
    'RecoveryPlanName'-StorSimRegKey: The registration key for the StorSimple manager    
    'RecoveryPlanName'-ResourceName: The name of the StorSimple resource
    'RecoveryPlanName'-DeviceName: The Device which has to be failed over
    'RecoveryPlanName'-TargetDeviceName: The Device on which the containers are to be failed over
    'RecoveryPlanName'-VolumeContainers: A comma separated string of volume containers present on the Device that need to be failed over, eg - "VolCon1,VolCon2" 
    'RecoveryPlanName'-AutomationAccountName: The name of the Automation Account in which the various runbooks are stored
    
.NOTES
    If a specified container can't be failed over then it'll be ignored
    If a volume container is part of a group (in case of shared backup policies) then the entire group will be failed over if even one of the containers from the group is not specified
